# Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze and segment a dataset using clustering algorithms. The study aims to determine the optimal number of clusters, identify key characteristics of each cluster, and derive actionable insights based on the clustering results.

## Problem Statement
The primary goal is to segment the dataset into meaningful clusters to uncover patterns and relationships within the data. By using clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and Birch, the project seeks to:
- Identify homogeneous groups within the data.
- Analyze distinguishing features of each cluster.
- Provide insights for potential practical applications of the clustering results.

## Key Features
- Evaluation of clustering performance using Silhouette Coefficient and Davies-Bouldin Index.
- Application of clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, and Birch.
- Determination of the optimal number of clusters and hyperparameter tuning.
- Analysis of cluster characteristics and identification of patterns in the data.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 15,000 entries, with a sample of 5,001 rows used for analysis. Key variables include:
- **Categorical Variables**: Includes nominal and ordinal data.
- **Non-Categorical Variables**: Includes numeric data such as quantity, value, and weight.
- **Derived Features**: Additional computed variables like `Total_Value` for enhanced analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Environment**: Google Colab
- **Version Control**: Git
